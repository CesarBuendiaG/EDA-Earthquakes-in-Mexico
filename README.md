# ¿Casualties of Coincidence?: September Earthquakes in Mexico

### Why Mexico?

Mexico is one of the countries with the highest seismic activity in America. Some of the most well-known earthquakes are: 
- September 19, 1985 (8.1)
- September 7, 2017 (8.2)
- September 19, 2017 (7.1)
- September 19, 2022 (7.7)  
  

These events have reinforced the prevailing belief that the likelihood of a major earthquake occurring on September 19 is quite high.  
We are going to specifically discuss about Mexico City and Mexico state, which are the places where there have been the most impacts (due to their high population density).  

### Data sources

In Mexico, we have the National Seismological Service [(SSN)](http://www.ssn.unam.mx/), which is responsible for keeping a record of all seismic events in the national territory. They also make this information available for consultation by periods and magnitudes.  
**For this analysis, we will take data from January 1, 1985, to December 31, 2022, and consider events with an intensity >= 4 (Richter scale).**
